Subject: AI is reshaping productivity tools

Hey Hemanth,

In this issue, we explore how artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming productivity tools. Google has integrated its Gemini model into Docs and Sheets to assist users with content generation and formatting. Meanwhile, Notion has introduced an AI writing assistant that helps with summarization and brainstorming. Microsoft is also enhancing Office 365 with Copilot, offering intelligent suggestions and auto-summarization of meetings. These changes aren’t just time-savers — they represent a shift in how we interact with work tools. Dive deeper into this AI-driven evolution in today’s full article.
